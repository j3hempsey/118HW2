1. 0.0000507270 seconds is the minimum time to send a message of any size.
2. As the message size grows, the slope of the line becomes linear, however in this case of a log-log plot this means it grows polyrathmically. In this case it is about x^2
3. for m <= 1000, time ~.00005seconds
       m > 1000, time ~m/10^m
4. We would hire joe. Susies implementation makes sense for a sequential 
	program, however when doing this in parallel with mpi, there is no way
	to "gather" every other row for example. So we can send one big 
	contiguous junk and spread it out across the main array or send 
	individual rows. Joes implementation will send contigous chunks that
	are easier to scatter and gather without the need to loop over the 
	chunks again
5. Joes model will probably scale better because we can give individual nodes
	realatively large chunks to chug along at where as master slave we will
	likely still have to do a lot of communication depending on the quantities
	the master sends, however this communication will slow processing down
